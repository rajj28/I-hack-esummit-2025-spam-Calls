# AWS Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the AWS environment required for the AI-powered fraud detection system.

---

## **1. Create an AWS Account**
1. Visit [AWS Signup Page](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. Create a new account or sign in to an existing account.
3. Configure billing preferences and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

---

## **2. Set Up AWS Services**
### **2.1 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
- Purpose: Store call data, VKYC session videos, and other input files.
- Steps:
  1. Navigate to the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/).
  2. Create a bucket (e.g., `fraud-detection-data`).
  3. Configure permissions to allow access for AWS Lambda and other services.
  4. Enable versioning for backup and recovery.

### **2.2 AWS Lambda**
- Purpose: Serverless computation for spam detection, deepfake analysis, and alerts.
- Steps:
  1. Go to the [Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).
  2. Create a new Lambda function for each feature (e.g., `spam-call-analysis`, `deepfake-detection`).
  3. Use Python as the runtime environment.
  4. Attach the necessary IAM roles (see IAM section below).

### **2.3 Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**
- Purpose: Store user and transaction data.
- Steps:
  1. Access the [RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).
  2. Create a new database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
  3. Configure security groups to allow access from Lambda functions.
  4. Enable automatic backups and replication if required.

### **2.4 Amazon SageMaker**
- Purpose: Train and deploy machine learning models for anomaly and deepfake detection.
- Steps:
  1. Go to the [SageMaker Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).
  2. Create a new notebook instance.
  3. Use prebuilt Jupyter notebooks to train models on sample data.
  4. Deploy trained models to endpoints for real-time inference.

### **2.5 Amazon Rekognition**
- Purpose: Perform facial and image analysis for VKYC.
- Steps:
  1. Navigate to the [Rekognition Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/).
  2. Create a collection for facial analysis.
  3. Configure IAM policies to allow Rekognition to access S3 buckets for VKYC videos.

### **2.6 Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
- Purpose: Send real-time alerts to users.
- Steps:
  1. Go to the [SNS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/).
  2. Create a new topic (e.g., `fraud-alerts`).
  3. Subscribe users to the topic via email or SMS.
  4. Integrate SNS with Lambda functions for automated alerts.

---

## **3. Configure IAM Roles and Policies**
- **Purpose:** Allow AWS services to securely interact with each other.
- Steps:
  1. Go to the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
  2. Create roles for:
     - Lambda with access to S3, RDS, Rekognition, and SageMaker.
     - SageMaker with access to S3 buckets for training data.
  3. Attach managed policies like `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AmazonRDSFullAccess`, etc.
  4. Use the principle of least privilege to minimize security risks.

---

## **4. CloudFormation Templates (Optional)**
- **Purpose:** Automate the setup of AWS resources.
- Steps:
  1. Use the CloudFormation templates provided in the `setup/CloudFormation_Templates` directory.
  2. Deploy the templates via the [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
  3. Monitor the status of the stack and verify resource creation.

---

## **5. Testing and Verification**
1. Test each AWS service individually to ensure proper configuration:
   - Upload sample files to S3 and trigger Lambda functions.
   - Test RDS connectivity using a sample database client.
   - Analyze videos/images with Rekognition.
2. Check the logs for Lambda functions in [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

---

## **6. Cost Management**
- Use the [AWS Cost Explorer](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-reports/) to track expenses.
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges.

---

## **7. Additional Notes**
- Enable **AWS CloudTrail** to track API activity for security.
- Regularly monitor **CloudWatch Dashboards** to ensure system performance.
- Ensure GDPR or other regional compliance by configuring data residency in S3.
