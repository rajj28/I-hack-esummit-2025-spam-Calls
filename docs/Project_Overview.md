# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Overview

The AI-Powered Fraud Detection System is a comprehensive solution designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in financial services. By leveraging advanced AI models and AWS cloud services, this system identifies spam calls, deepfake fraud in VKYC (Video Know Your Customer) sessions, and unauthorized financial transactions in real-time. The system enhances trust in digital communication and financial transactions while safeguarding vulnerable communities from scams and exploitation.

## Key Features

1. **Spam Call Detection**:
   - Transcribes call audio using AWS Transcribe.
   - Analyzes transcripts for phishing keywords using NLP (AWS Comprehend).
   - Flags calls based on metadata, such as call frequency and duration.

2. **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**:
   - Uses Amazon Rekognition for facial and video analysis.
   - Detects anomalies in facial features and voice patterns using machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker.

3. **Financial Fraud Detection**:
   - Monitors transaction data for unusual patterns using AWS Glue for ETL processes.
   - Implements anomaly detection algorithms with Isolation Forests or custom models trained on SageMaker.

4. **Real-Time Alerts**:
   - Sends real-time notifications to users via Amazon SNS.
   - Provides a user interface built with AWS Amplify and Flask for reporting and viewing fraud alerts.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Call recordings, VKYC videos, and transaction data are stored in Amazon S3.
   - AWS Glue processes transaction logs for analysis.

2. **Processing and Detection**:
   - Lambda functions trigger fraud detection workflows.
   - SageMaker models analyze data for anomalies and deepfake detection.

3. **Alerts and Feedback**:
   - Amazon SNS sends real-time alerts to users.
   - A feedback loop improves detection accuracy through user reports.

## Uniqueness

This project stands out due to its:
- **Holistic Approach**: Tackles multiple fraud aspects (spam detection, deepfake analysis, financial anomalies) in one solution.
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Built using AWS services to handle high volumes of data with low latency.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Leverages advanced machine learning models for real-time detection and decision-making.
