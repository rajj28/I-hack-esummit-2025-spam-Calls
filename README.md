# 🔒 AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Overview
This project develops an AI-powered solution to detect and prevent spam calls, deepfake fraud, and VKYC exploitation in financial services. By leveraging AWS services, the system identifies suspicious activities in real-time through analysis of call metadata, behavioral patterns, and transaction data. Users are alerted instantly, enhancing trust and security in digital communication systems.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📞 **Spam Call Detection**: Converts call audio to text using AWS Transcribe and analyzes metadata and transcripts for fraud indicators.
- 🎭 **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**: Uses Amazon Rekognition and machine learning models in Amazon SageMaker to identify facial and voice anomalies.
- 💰 **Financial Fraud Detection**: Monitors transaction data using AWS Glue and SageMaker to detect suspicious activities.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends immediate notifications to users via Amazon SNS when potential threats are detected.
- 🔄 **User Feedback Loop**: Gathers user reports through a UI and incorporates feedback into system updates.

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Calls and VKYC session data uploaded to Amazon S3.
   - Transaction data ingested via AWS Glue.

2. **Processing**:
   - AWS Lambda functions analyze data for spam detection, deepfake analysis, and fraud detection.
   - Amazon SageMaker trains models for facial and voice anomaly detection.
   
3. **Alerts and Feedback**:
   - Suspicious activities trigger alerts via Amazon SNS.
   - Users provide feedback through a UI built with AWS Amplify.
